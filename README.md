 # Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is even or odd using if...else statements.

# Algorithm
Get an input from the user.
Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable a.
Use the modulo operator % to check if a % 2 == 0.
If true, print "EVEN".
Else, print "ODD".
End the program.
# Program
```
a=int(input())
if(a%2==0):
print(f"a is NoT an Odd number")
else:
print(f"(a) is an Odd number")
```
# Output

# Result
Thus,program to find whether a number is odd or even is executed successfully.
# pg:2
# Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

# Algorithm
Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
Print the value of a with the label "a is".
Print the value of b with the label "b is".
Print the value of c with the label "c:".
Print the value of d with the label "d:".
# Program
```
a=(1==True)
print("a is", a)
b=(0==False)
print("b is", b)
c=True+5
d=False+9
print("c:",c)
print("d:", d)
```

# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python
# Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals.

# Algorithm
Print the character 'T'.
Print the character 'a'.
# Program
```
z='T'
y='a'
print(z)
print(y)
```
# Output

# Result
Thus,the required program is executed successfully.
# Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
# Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

# Algorithm
Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
Print the complex number x.
Print the real part of x using x.real.
Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.
# Program
```
r=int(input())
i=int(input())
z=complex(r, i)
print(z)
print(z.real)
print(z.imag)
```
# Output

# Result
Thus,the required program is executed successfully.
# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python
# Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

# Algorithm
Assign a variable named men_stepped_on_the_moon.
Use input() to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
Print the value stored in the variable.
# Program
```
a ="""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
consectetur adipiscing elit, 
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
```
# Output

# Result
Thus,the required program is executed successfully.
